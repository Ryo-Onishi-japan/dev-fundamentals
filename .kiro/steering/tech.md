# Technical Steering

## Key Technologies

This project utilizes a diverse set of technologies to provide a comprehensive learning experience:

-   **Development Environment:** Node.js (for Gemini CLI and potentially other tools), Gemini CLI, GitHub CLI.
-   **Version Control:** Git, with GitHub for repository hosting and collaborative workflows (Issues, Pull Requests).
-   **Backend Programming:** Java (for application logic).
-   **Database Interaction:** PL/SQL (for stored procedures, triggers, and database manipulation).
-   **AI Development:** Gemini (for AI coding assistance and adherence to AI-DLC principles).

## Architectural Principles

-   **Modularity:** Emphasize clear separation of concerns, especially between application logic (Java), database logic (PL/SQL), and development tooling.
-   **Spec-Driven Development (Kiro-style):** Leverage specifications to guide AI-assisted development, ensuring alignment with requirements and design.
-   **Automation:** Utilize scripting (e.g., `bash scripts/setup.sh`) and CLI tools (Gemini CLI, GitHub CLI) for efficient setup and workflow execution.

## Conventions

-   **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation in Markdown format is crucial for learning and project understanding (e.g., `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `TUTORIAL.md`).
-   **AI-DLC Integration:** All AI-assisted development should align with the AI Development Life Cycle defined in `GEMINI.md`.
